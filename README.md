## Day 1 ( 30 July 2025 )
###      (Shabad Kirtan)
####                          GNDE (GURU NANAK DEV  ENGINEERING) College organized a Shabad Kirtan and Ardas program on July 30, 2025 in college gurudwara saib to celebrate the start of the new semester and to congratulate the students of the first semester of the batch for their academic excellence. I noticed that the shape of the Gurudwara Sahib of GNDE is like a ship, looking at the roof, it seems like we are in the ship of God. About an hour after the ceremony ended, it seemed like this. Today, we traveled on this ship for about an hour. The mind found peace through the recitation heard in this program and the words sung by the Kirtani Jatha.
          After the end of the Program, we all had tea and as per the schedule, we went to the college auditorium.
### ( In Auditorium )
         ### Upon arrival at the college auditorium, the first meeting of all students was facilitated by the Principal, Dr. Sahijpal Singh, who extended a warm welcome and congratulations to the new students on their admission. He shared insights from his life experiences, highlighting struggles and successes, with the aim of inculcating essential values like discipline and altruism among the  students.They gave us information about being successful in life, along with a B.Tech degree.
       #### "Following the meeting with the Principal, we had the opportunity to interact with the Head of Department, Madam Harpreet Kaur. She shared valuable insights from her own experiences, offering guidance on navigating life's challenges and achieving success. She emphasized the significance of this phase in our lives, highlighting its role in shaping our  thoughts, perspectives, and future   endeavors.
